## About this COVID-19 Demographics Dashboard

This dashboard was created out of necessity, when I asked myself the question "What age group makes up the majority of COVID deaths for my state?" and "most dashboards list cases with 'rolling averages' or 'last 7 days', but no deaths? How lethal is this disease if I can't measure the cases against the deaths?"...

This lead me down a path of trying to find a complete set of data that I could download for my state, which then lead me to find more data for each state... which then lead me down the path to finding COVID data about age ranges and race groups.

## The more we know, the more we grow!

The ultimate purpose of this dashboard is to help people like you empower yourselves with simple, yet effective knowledge that comes from the New York Times and the CDC. I want to help educate people on generally how deadly the COVID-19 disease in the United States by pulling official data and calculating those numbers to get a mortality rate â€“ or rather the relative chances one would have if they contracted COVID in a certain geographical area in the United States.
